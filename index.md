# CIT 281 User Page

## Hello World

This is my user page for CIT 281. In this class I learned Github, npm, express, now, and surge. I made three different photo apps that return images from three different services, Flickr, 500px, and Unsplash. This required building different api and get requests and parsing JSON correctly. For the last project I learned how to use the YouTube api and the display videos on request.
